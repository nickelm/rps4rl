# rps4rl

**RPs4RL**, short for **Realm Points for Real Life**, is an everyday gamification utility in the style of [Dark Age of Camelot](https://darkageofcamelot.com/). The purpose of RPs4RL is to enable you to gamify everyday activities, such as mowing the law, taking out the trash, or doing dishes, adding DAoC-style realm points for every task you achieve in real life. Use it to track your own progress or to compete with your friends!

## Simple Usage

Download the HTML page or run it from the hosted link. Achieve tasks by selection from the Actions dropdown menu; you will be immediately rewarded with realm points and your total will increase. The **Stats** button will give you a summary of your performance during the session, and the **Clear** button will start a new session (while allowing you to keep your realm point total).

If you want to customize the Actions list, click the **Settings** link at the top. You can now add, edit, or delete tasks from this list, including their RP value. Use the **Export2Clip** button to export your list of actions to the clipboard, for example to send the same action list to the friend that you are competing with. They can simply paste the string (the full string) into the "Import" field and click the checkbutton to save.

Additional buttons in the Settings window enable you to reset the Action list to the default as well as clear your own RPs.

## Implementation Details

RPs4RL is a simple web-based utility written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that uses the [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) to store persistent data on the user's local browser. The tool is built using Bootstrap to create a device-responsive user experience that should work on both mobile phones as well as computers.
